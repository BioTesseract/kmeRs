Description: Similarity Score Matrix and HeatMap for nucleic and amino acid k-mers. Similarity score is evaluated by Point Accepted Mutation (PAM) and BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix (BLOSUM). Higher similarity score indicates more similar sequences for BLOSUM and less similar sequences for PAM matrix. The 30, 40, 70, 120, 250 and 62, 45, 50, 62, 80, 100 matrix versions are available for PAM and BLOSUM, respectively. Alignment is evaluated by Needleman-Wunsch [@NEEDLEMAN1970443] and Smith-Waterman  [@SMITH1981195].
